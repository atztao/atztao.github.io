Discrete Boltzmann Modeling of Non-equilibrium Complex Flows
</p>

<p>
In this talk, we will briefly review the progress of discrete
Boltzmann modeling, simulation and analysis of complex flows in our
group in recent years. The topics are relevant to multiphase flows,
non-equilibrium phase transition, shock wave, combustion and
hydrodynamic instability. Mathematically, the only difference of
discrete Boltzmann from the traditional hydrodynamic modeling is that
the NS equations are replaced by a discrete Boltzmann equation. But
physically, this replacement has a meaningful gain: the discrete
Boltzmann model (DBM) can work as a hydrodynamic model supplemented by
a coarse-grained model of the Thermodynamic Non-Equilibrium (TNE)
effects, where the hydrodynamic model can be the Navier-Stokes(NS) and
can also beyond the NS. The observations on TNE have been used to
access more precisely the specific aspects of TNE, to estimate more
quantitatively the deviation amplitude from thermodynamic equilibrium
state, to recover the main feature of real distribution function, to
obtain more accurate viscous stress and heat flux for hydrodynamic
modeling, to investigate various mechanisms resulting in entropy
increase, to distinguish different stages of non-equilibrium phase
transition, to discriminate and capture various interfaces, to
differentiate shock waves in plasma from those in common fluids, etc.

An unorthodox thermal system analogue of the onset of chaos
</p>

<p>
We systematically eliminate access to configurations of an otherwise
elementary thermal system model until only remains a subset of them of
vanishing measure. The thermal system consists of 2N distinguishable
non-interacting degrees of freedom, each occupying energy levels of
the form u<sub>j,k</sub> = 2<sup>j</sup> 2<sup>2k</sup>, j,k = 0,1,2,&#x2026; The system's configurations
are eliminated when their energies do not match the form 2<sup>N</sup>-l,
l=0,1,2,&#x2026;, leading to a discrete scale invariant set of available
configurations as N approaches infinity. In doing this we achieve the
following results: 1) The constrained thermal system becomes an
analogue of the dynamics towards the multifractal attractor at the
period-doubling onset of chaos. 2) The statistical-mechanical
properties of the thermal system depart from those of the ordinary
Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) form and acquire features from q-statistics. 3)
Redefinition of energy levels as logarithms of the original ones
recovers the BG scheme and the free energy Legendre transform
property. We demonstrate that q-entropy expressions apply naturally to
statistical–mechanical systems that experience an exceptional
contraction of their configuration space. We illustrate this
circumstance for properties of systems that find descriptions in terms
of nonlinear maps. These are size-rank functions, urbanization and
similar processes, and settings where frequency locking takes place.

Modeling phoneme distribution: the effect of author-dependence 
</p>

<p>
We study rank-frequency relations for phonemes, the minimal units that
still relate to linguistic meaning. We show that these relations can
be described by the Dirichlet distribution, a direct analogue of the
ideal-gas model in statistical mechanics. This description allows us
to demonstrate that the rank-frequency relations for phonemes of a
text do depend on its author. The author-dependency effect is not
caused by the author’s vocabulary (common words used in different
texts), and is confirmed by several alternative means. This suggests
that it can be directly related to phonemes. These features contrast
to rank-frequency relations for words, which are both author and text
independent and are governed by the Zipf’s law.

Attack Vulnerability and Epidemic Dynamics on two interdependent
networks 
</p>

<p>
In this talk, I will discuss two problems, on one hand, I will talk
about the impact of Partially coupling and coupling preference on the
attack vulnerability on two interdependent networks; on the other
hand, I will the epidemic processes on two multiplex networks, and
investigate the effect of heterogeneous individual awareness on the
spreading behaviors within complex populations. The results indicate
that interdependency further enriches our understanding regarding the
structural properties and dynamics within real-world networks

Reconstructing complex networks from discrete time series.
</p>

<p>
Data based reconstruction of complex networked systems has been an
active area of research in network science and engineering with
applications in a wide range of disciplines. In this talk, I will
introduct two methods regarding network reconstruction. One approach
is based on the statistical inference, the other is the mean-field
based maximum likelihood estimation approach. different approaches
handle different situations. Our results indicate that the performance
of each approach is superior to the existing methods.

Visibility Graphlet Approach To Time Series 
</p>

<p>
In the present paper we propose a new method to extract structural
patterns at different scales in a time series. First, from a time
series we extract all the possible segments with a specified length,
then map every segment to a graphlet to represent the state of the
system in the corresponding duration; Second, linking each pair of
successive states results into a chain of states. All the
distinguishable states form a state network (transfer matrix between
states); Third, from the transfer matrix we can extract the short-term
and long-term relations of the states and patterns of the time
series. This method proves its powerful in identifying characteristics
of deterministic processes , stochastic processes and empirical
records for stock markets. References [1] M. Stephen, C. Gu, and

Modelling and Application of Online User Collective behaviors 
</p>

<p>
understanding the evolution characteristics of social relations is
significant to identify important people who is linked by strong
social ties in online social networks (OSNs). In this paper, we
empirically investigate the evolution characteristics of Facebook and
Wiki users' \emph{social signature}, capturing the distribution of
frequency of interactions between different alters over time in ego
network. The statistical results show that there are robust social
signatures for collective egos based on interactions. Notably,
individual social signature remains stable, no matter how alters
change over time. Furthermore, we use structure information of OSNs to
analyze the social closeness in each interval in terms of embeddedness
measurement, presenting that alters identified from structural
information still show the characteristic of social
signature. Moreover, the embeddedness could predict at least average
33.47\% alters and at most average 66.90\% alters. This work enables
an effective method for identifying potential highly-related friends
based on the regularity of social signature in online social network.

Study on chaotic characteristics of memristor in neuron system 
</p>

<p>
The memristors have many meaningful characteristics, such as, memory, forgetting property as well as experiential learning and so on. These properties are similar to those of biological nerve synapses, therefore, the memristor may be used as the synapse between neurons to construct a neural network, and study the chaotic behavior and law theoretically by using numerical simulation.

A New Nonlinear Dopant Kinetic Model of Memristor 
</p>

<p>
To further optimize the drift model of memristor, in this paper, based
on both the existing nonlinear doping dynamics model and sinusoidal
function, a new model is proposed, which agrees with the five criteria
for describing the migration characteristics of nonlinear
dopant. Secondly, to improve the flexibility of the new model, two
internal parameters are introduced, and it is verified by using the
coupling variable resistor model proposed by HP team. The simulation
results show that the model is well matched with the authoritative
model. At the same time, the new model can also effectively avoid the
"terminal state problem" of the memristor. Furthermore, when the
different driving voltages with adjustable amplitude and frequency are
introduced, the memristor characteristics can well realize in this new
model. Our results show that the new model not only accords with the
standard of the window function, but also has better flexibility. It
will provide a new idea for the memristor to be widely used in
intelligent calculation, artificial synapse and many other fields.

How Neural Systems Fuse Information from Different Channels 
</p>


<p>
Neural systems gather information from different channels resulting in
enhanced reliability. The optimal estimate is given by Bayes' rule,
and remarkably the brain can achieve this optimum. It is therefore
interesting to consider the neural architecture and mechanism
underlying this feat. We study a decentralized network architecture
where same-channel and cross-channel information are processed in
parallel. Using stochastic gradient descent, projections to basis
functions, and a perturbative approach in the limit of weak
correlation, the most striking discovery is that the direct and
indirect cross-channel pathways are opposite to each other &#x2013; an
apparently redundant architecture.

Systems Approach to Complex Human Microbial Networks 
</p>

<p>
Our resident gut microbial community, or gut microbiome, provides us
with a variety of biochemical capabilities not encoded in our
genes. This human gut microbiome is linked not only to our health, but
also to various disorders such as obesity, cancer, and diabetes. We
constructed the literature-curated global interaction network of the
human gut microbiome mediated by various chemicals. Using our network,
we conducted a systematic analysis of the microbiomes in type 2
diabetes patients, and revealed the metabolic infrastructure of the
gut ecosystem implicated in disease. Our network framework shows
promise for investigating complex microbe-microbe and host-microbe
chemical cross-talk, and identifying disease-associated features.

Hysteresis and Duration Dependence of Financial Crises in the US:
Evidence from 1871-2016 
</p>

<p>
This paper analyses the duration dependence of events that trigger
volatility persistence in stock markets. Such events, in our context,
are monthly spells of contiguous price decline or negative returns
for the S&amp;P500 stock market index over the last 145 years. Factors
known to affect the duration of these spells are the magnitude or
intensity of the price decline, long-term interest rates and economic
recessions, among others. The result of interest is the conditional
probability of ending a spell of consecutive months over which stock
market returns remain negative. In this paper, we rely on continuous
time survival models to investigate this question. Several
specifications were attempted under the accelerated failure time
assumption. The best fit of the various models endeavored was
obtained for the log-Normal distribution. This distribution yields a
non-monotonic hazard function that increases up to a maximum and then
decreases. The peak is achieved 2-3 months after the spells onset
with a hazard of around 0.9 or higher; this hazard then decays
asymptotically to zero. Spell duration increases during recessions,
when interest rate rises and when price declines are more
intense. The main conclusion is that short spells of negative returns
are mainly frictional while long spells become structural and trigger
hysteresis effects after an initial period of adjustment. These
results may be important for policy-makers.

Some progresses in modeling, analysis and application of
interdependent complex networks 
</p>

<p>
Interdependent networks are of basic models towards networks of
networks, where the interactions between subnetworks are considered
to support each subnetworks. This model has widely applied to model
infrastructure networks, social networks, and economic networks
etc. this talk, I will introduce some progresses in analyzing and
applying this sort of models in twofold. First, I will present a
simple and efficient algorithm to maximize the largest eigenvalue of
interdependent network by optimally selecting the inter-network
connects. Second, I will present an example of applying this model
for a novel bi-clustering algorithm by detecting the community
structure on interdependent networks.

Analysis and Modeling of the Adaptive Coevolution in Heterogeneous
Double-Layer Networks 
</p>

<p>
This paper constructs a heterogeneous double-layer network of
scientific collaboration and citation, using a dataset of computer
science academic literatures. This paper examines the adaptive
coevolution phenomenon between scientific collaboration and citation
and presents a model of the heterogeneous double-layer networks which
not only reproduces the adaptive coevolution phenomenon of the real
network, but also fits multiple measures of real network well. Our
work may provide a feasible way to understanding the adaptive
inter-layer interaction in heterogeneous double-layer networks.

Risk Contagion Analysis Based on a Complex Credit Network Model 
</p>

<p>
The recent crisis has brought to the fore a crucial question that
remains still open: what is the role of financial network plays in
systemic risk propagation? We have presented an analysis of the
impact that network topology can have on systemic risk. Our results
extend previous studies on contagion in random interbank network to
coupled credit network consisting of bank and firm sector. We
investigate the stability of several benchmark topologies in a simple
default cascading dynamics in credit networks.Our results emphasize
the role played by “contagious links” and show that institutions
which contribute most to network instability have both large
connectivity and a large fraction of contagious links. We also find
that no single topology is always superior to others. In particular,
scale-free networks can be both more robust and more fragile than
homogeneous architectures. This finding has important policy
implications.

Information propagation in directed networks 
</p>

<p>
The investigation of structure and dynamics of complex networks has
attracted contributions from applied mathematicians and statistical
physicists over the last several decades. Of high interest is a broad
range of dynamical processes unfolding over underline networks, e.g.,
information propagation. The threshold model has been widely adopted
as a classic model for studying such contagion processes on social
networks. Previous studies, however, have paid less attention on
sddirected properties of nodes or links. In this paper, a modified
threshold model on directed networks has been proposed and studied by
Monte-Carlo simulations. Two regimes of the underline networks are
identified in which the system exhibits distinct behaviors.

Synchronous Patterns in Complex Networks 
</p>

<p>
An intriguing phenomenon observed in systems of coupled oscillators
is the cluster synchronization. In cluster synchronization,
oscillators within the same cluster are highly synchronized, but are
not if the oscillators are from different clusters. Previously,
cluster synchronization has been studied in systems of regular
network structures, and its emergence is attributed to the breaking
of the network symmetry. Recently, stimulated by the progress of
network science, cluster synchronization in complex networks begins
to be interested too. In this talk, we will introduce our recent
progresses on the formation of synchronous clusters in complex
networks, including 1) how to figure out the cluster synchronization
states according to the network symmetries; 2) how to analyze the
stability of the cluster synchronization states; and 3) how to
control the cluster synchronization states. The studies enrich our
understanding on the pattern dynamics of complex networks, and are of
implications to the functionality and operation of many realistic
systems.

Progress on Equivalent transformation and reciprocal characterization
between complex networks and time series 
</p>

<p>
The complex networks and time series are two classical paradigms to
describe the real complex systems. But the complexity of systems
determines that we merely can obtain the specific properties of the
object given the single paradigm. To address this problem, recently
transformation between complex networks and time series becomes
promising research. People begin to pay much attention to their
internal relationship. Inspired by the previous work, we emphasize
the theoretical foundation of equivalent transformation between
complex networks and time series so as to ensure the consistency of
dynamics of complex system during transformation, thereby providing
theoretical evidences for their reciprocal characterization. Based on
that, we confirm and quantify the corresponding relationship between
both counterparts, and provide characterization methods for their
integrated application in practice so as to comprehensively
understand complex systems from the dual perspectives of complex
networks and time series.

Explosive phenomena in complex networks 
</p>

<p>
Explosive percolation, which was discovered in 2009, corresponds to
an abrupt change in the network’s structure, and explosive
synchronization (which is concerned, instead, with the abrupt
emergence of a collective state in the networks’ dynamics) was
studied as early as the first models of globally coupled phase
oscillators were taken into consideration. Given their relevance to
practical applications, explosive percolation and synchronization
have attracted a comprehensive and lasting attention in various
fields, and have stimulated a large amount of exciting works and
debates. The result is that many substantial contributions and
progresses (including experimental verifications) are today
available, which provide a rather deep insight on the crucial
structural and dynamical mechanisms at the basis of the abruptness of
the two transitions. It is therefore now the time to offer a
comprehensive review on the current state of the art on the subject,
which would offer a reflected and thought out viewpoint on the many
achievements and developments, as well as a weighted and meditated
outlook to the still open questions and to the possible directions
for future research. In this talk, I will show some of our
contributions in these two research directions.

Communities are ubiquitous in nature and society. Individuals that
share common properties often self-organize to form
communities. Avoiding the shortages of computation complexity,
pre-given information and unstable results in different run, we
propose a simple and efficient method to deepen our understanding of
the emergence and diversity of communities in complex systems. By
introducing the rational random selection, our method reveals the
hidden deterministic and normal diverse community states of community
struc- ture. To demonstrate this method, we test it with real-world
systems. The results show that our method could not only detect
community structure with high sensitivity and reliability, but also
provide instructional information about the hidden deterministic
community world and our normal diverse community world by giving out
the core-community, the real-community, the tide and the
diversity. This is of paramount importance in understanding,
predicting, and controlling a variety of collective behaviors in
complex systems.
